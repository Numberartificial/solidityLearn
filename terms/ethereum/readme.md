## Ethereum

### White Paper
Ethereum: The ultimate Smart contract and decentralized application platform.
> A secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger.
> Ethereum, taken as a whole, can be viewed as a
transaction-based state machine: we begin with a genesis state and incrementally execute transactions to morph
it into some current state
> Smart contract(Turing completeness EVM as the execution environment)

**note**: 
  1. take more programmatic control over transactions to fix(extend) bitcoin system.
  2. enable creation of DAC(decentralized autonomous corporations)
